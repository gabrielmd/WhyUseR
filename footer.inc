<div class="footer">
This text is my footer text<br>
Normally, the top of the text block would appear 90% of the way down the slide (i.e., at the bottom), because that is how the 'top' property is defined in the 'footer' style. However this particular footer wraps onto multiple lines, so we shift it up by specifying a negative value for the 'margin-top' property.</div>
